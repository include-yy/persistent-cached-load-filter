* PCLF --- Persistent Cached Load Filter

This package provides a persistent cache mechanism for =load-path=
lookups to speed up Emacs startup and library loading.

It leverages the =load-path-filter-function= variable introduced in
Emacs 31. By caching the directory locations of loaded libraries to a
file, it reduces the number of system calls (stat/access) required when
=require= or =load= is called, particularly beneficial for systems with
slow I/O or large =load-path= lists.

** Install and Use

Use the following command to install:

#+begin_src text
package-vc-install RET https://github.com/include-yy/persistent-cached-load-filter RET
#+end_src

Or in your init.el file:

#+begin_src elisp
  (setopt package-vc-selected-packages
          '(;; Other packages
            ;; ...
            (persistent-cached-load-filter
             :url "https://github.com/include-yy/persistent-cached-load-filter")))

  (package-vc-install-selected-packages)
#+end_src

After installation, add these lines in your init.el as early as possible:

#+begin_src elisp
  (when (require 'persistent-cached-load-filter nil t)
    (persistent-cached-load-filter-easy-setup))
#+end_src

** Cache Lifecycle

The package manages the cache automatically during your Emacs session:

- *Runtime Updates:* When a library is requested via =load= or =require= and is not found in the cache, PCLF performs a standard search. The result is immediately added to the in-memory cache.
- *Automatic Saving:* The cache is saved to =load-path-cache.eld= in your =user-emacs-directory= automatically when Emacs exits. It only writes to disk if changes were made during the session.

** Manual Operations

You can manually manage the cache with the following commands:

- =M-x persistent-cached-load-filter-write-cache= :: Immediately writes the in-memory cache to disk. It automatically removes duplicates and non-existent files before writing.
- =M-x persistent-cached-load-filter-clear-cache= :: Clears the cache from both memory and disk. Use this if you want to force a complete rebuild of the cache.
